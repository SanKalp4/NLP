Objective of the problem

Given a list of more than 1000+ text (dataset attached) from news websites around the globe:

    1. Clean the dataset- drop rows with missing/ incorrect data
    
    2. Write a data frame query to find all names of UNIQUE sources and retrieve their count i.e., number of articles from each source.
    
    • Create a suitable visualization representing each news source (X-axis) and number of articles (Y-axis). Which news websites has the maximum number of articles? 
    
    • Perform the same process to get names of all authors and articles written by each. Plot a visualization for the same. 
    
    3. Have 2 or more authors written more than 1 article together? 
       
       If yes, represent with a suitable visualization/ table with names of authors who have collaborated/ worked together and the count/number of the articles for each pair. 


Basic EDA, Dataframe manipulation using Pandas,Lemmatization has been used for the above project. Named Entity Recognition has been used to identify important person,org,norp etc from article.Used Displacy to visualise NER.

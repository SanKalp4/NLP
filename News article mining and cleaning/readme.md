Objective of the problem

Given a list of more than 1000+ text (dataset attached) from news websites around the globe:

    1. Clean the dataset- drop rows with missing/ incorrect data
    
    2. Write a data frame query to find all names of UNIQUE sources and retrieve their count i.e., number of articles from each source.
    
    • Create a suitable visualization representing each news source (X-axis) and number of articles (Y-axis). Which news websites has the maximum number of articles? 
    
    • Perform the same process to get names of all authors and articles written by each. Plot a visualization for the same. 
    
    3. Have 2 or more authors written more than 1 article together? 
       
       If yes, represent with a suitable visualization/ table with names of authors who have collaborated/ worked together and the count/number of the articles for each pair.
